				What is an LTSC Contract ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				An LTSC contract provides an investor with the right to secure to a residential lot at todays price, without having to settle on that land for 5, 7 or even 10 years. This means that the investor can take advantage of the capital growth that occurs in the property market over the term of the contract with just a minimal capital outlay.

			</div>

				<div class="arrow"></div>
				Can I pay more upfront ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				Yes you can. Making a larger initial payment helps to make the ongoing payments more manageable and mitigates cash flow risk that may arise. This is because the vendor terms are interest free which means every dollar you pay builds equity. Talk to your consultant about how a larger initial payment can reduce your monthly installments.

				Can I reduce my monthly payments ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">

			</div>

				Can I buy more than 1 ?

				Can I settle before the LTSC term is up ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				No you can not. The term is fixed as per your contractual agreement. The developer may however call for investors to settle early, and any investors that take up this offer will receive a 5% discount on the final settlement price.

				What if the property market crashes ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				If the property market crashes you can decide to walk away at anytime, with no contractual obligation to the developer. This is truly a world first. In a traditional property transaction investors would be forced to negotiate with banks or nonbank lenders due to mortgages and personal guarantees. This may result in the investor being liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars that they don't have if their property gets short sold.
			</div>

			<div class="spoilerButton">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				Will the developer finance the deferred payment as well ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				Yes. Any additional monthly payments that you make above the required minimum will go towards reducing your deferred payment, and because the terms are interest free every dollar that pay goes towards building equity, not paying interest.
			</div>

			<div class="spoilerButton">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				Is there any interest to pay ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				No. Currently the payment plans are offered on interest free vendor terms. Try and find that with a traditional property investment.
			</div>

				What happens if I lose my Job ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				If you lose your job contact your LTSC specialist immediately. We understand that temporary financial setbacks happen. We will work with every investor to ensure that they do not miss out on this opportunity.
			</div>

			<div class="spoilerButton">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				Does the developer offer any security ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				The security that the developer provides all investors is the contractual obligation to deliver the lot before the end of the LTSC term. On top of that because the contract is stamped with the state of Victoria, the investor also has the right to lodge a caveat over the lot they purchase with Land Victoria.
			</div>

			<div class="spoilerButton">
				<div class="arrow"></div>
				What happens if I don't have the funds to settle ?
			</div>
			<div class="spoiler">
				The developer is offering an automatic extended settlement period for investors that can not afford to settle at the end of the LTSC period. If you feel you are going to be in this situation as you approach settlement contact your LTSC specialist and they will discuss the opportunities that are available to you. This may include on selling your LTSC to a third party buyer.
