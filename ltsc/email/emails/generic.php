Dear <?php echo $client_name ?>
</p>
<p>
<a href="<?php echo $ltscPdf ?>" target="_blank">Click here</a> for your guide to LTSC (long term settlement contracts).
</p>
<p>
Long term settlement contracts have been used by property developers and sophisticated investors for decades as a way to maximise return and limit downside risk.
</p>
<p>
Arion Group is proud to be among the first in Australia to offer this investment method to the general public.
</p>
<p>
In simple terms an LTSC allows investors to secure property today, at todays price without having to settle on the property for 5, 7 or even 10 years, while being able to capatilise on all of the capital growth that occurs over that time.
</p>
<p>
Please take the the time to review and understand your guide to LTSC which can be found by following the link at the bottom of this email.
</p>
<p>
We will be in touch in the next couple of days to answer any questions you may have.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to organise an online appointment with one of our senior LTSC specialists feel free to log onto <a href="http://www.cottonparkestate.com" target="_blank">www.cottonparkestate.com</a> and book a webinar online.
</p>
<p>
We look forward to speaking to soon.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,
</p>
<p>
